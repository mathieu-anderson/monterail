# My solution

### Choice of nuxt.js :
- Vue lets me hit all the tasks given while also letting me write vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript in single file components.
- Nuxt.js gives me a simple file architecture with all the tools I need for the more advanced tasks (easy SASS integration, Vuex for state management, routing).

### Choice of SASS :
- The design provided are very consistant : SASS makes it easier to centralize the style constants.

### CSS methodology :
- BEM : an attempt to keep the naming convention semantically significant.

## Build Setup

$ npm install # Or yarn install
